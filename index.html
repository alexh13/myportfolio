                <p class="main-text">
                    Hello! Welcome to my home page. My name is Alex. I'm 25 years old and currently majoring in Computer
                    Science at City College of San Francisco. I have experience with Python, my primary language of
                    choice, and recently took up HTML5 and CSS. I am looking forward to learning C++ this coming Spring
                    Semester. Prior to starting college, I spent four years in the United States Army. After I finished
                    my enlistment, I returned home and joined a Union Hall out of Martinez working in the construction
                    industry. After a year and a half in construction, I decided to return to school and pursue a degree
                    in Computer Science. Click on the buttons at the bottom of this page to learn more about my
                    experiences!

                    My weekly affairs generally involve exercising at the gym, finishing school work, and creating and
                    learning more software development. It wasn't until I began college that I realized I have a real
                    passion for this world of computers and languages. In just six months since realizing this passion,
                    I have only become more motivated to keep learning and seeing what programs I can create. Click on
                    the Github button at the bottom of this page to see some of the programs I have created so far!

                    I spend any free time away from school work and programming by going on adventures with my two
                    huskies, Jax and Luna.
